4. Separate chapter for tool
5. Experimental setup & results
	Evaluation setup -> Corpus
	Results

-> Compare my tool vs others. (separate experiment & first experiment)

Paper: these are missing things and how I fixed it in my tool. One paragraph briefly give surface description of the tool.

Figure 2: OUR abstract representation of clone classes and instances
Make it clear what is YOUR contribution
We introduce ...

Make more clear how context relates to the defined types. Eq.~\ref{eq:t3r}

Proportion (0-100) vs ratio (any %)


Do we want dynamic thresholds?
-> Yes, for sure! Token thresholds need to be dependent on:
				- The relation
				- The clone type

				- The number of parameters that the refactored method would get
				- Complexity of the refactored method (?) -> Both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity would do I guess
				- Size of the refactored method (?)
