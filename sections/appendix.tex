\todo{Need to think about what to put here. I have a lot of stuff I'd like to put here, however my datasets are rather large. For one, I'd like to put my list of used systems here. However, it has 2267 items. I would like to put the refactorings here. However, it has 12684 items. I'd like to share more CloneRefactor output and stuff. However, it is rather much.}

\todo{Appendix: definitely share some tables in which the metrics are still separated and not yet aggregated. If the aggregation is wrong, we at least have the separated numbers.}
