\label{ch:research_method}

Depending on your subject, you might need multiple research chapters. Moreover, depending on how the research questions are linked, you may need to answer them one by one and then connect the answers into a final discussion chapter. 

See Canvas for examples of theses with various approaches to structuring the research content.
