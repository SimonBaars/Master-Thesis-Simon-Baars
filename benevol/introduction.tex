\section{Introduction}


Most clone detection tools can be configured using thresholds. These thresholds indicate the minimum number of lines, tokens and/or statements that must be spanned for duplicate fragments to be considered clones. Often, such thresholds are intuitively chosen~\cite{li2006cp, roy2009mutation} or based on a quartile distribution of empirical data~\cite{alves2010deriving}. Using the maintainability score we can find support for which thresholds should be chosen to increase the chance to find clones that improve maintainability when refactored.
